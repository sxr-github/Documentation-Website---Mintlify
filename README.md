## Deployment

There are two common ways to deploy:

> With Mintlify Hosting

Connect this GitHub repo to your Mintlify workspace. Once connected, Mintlify will automatically build and publish your documentation site after every push/merge to the default branch.

> Self-Hosting (Optional)

If you prefer to deploy independently (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel), build and serve your static site from the repo’s source files.
